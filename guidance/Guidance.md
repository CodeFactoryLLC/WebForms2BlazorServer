# WebFormsToBlazorServer Guidance
This set of documentation goes into the details of the example CodeFactory Code Automation Template **WebFormsToBlazor**.  If you need explainations of what a Code Automation Template is or how CodeFactory works please use the following link to that documentation.  [CodeFactory Guidance](http://docs.codefactory.software/guidance/intro.html)

## Template Overview
In order to make use of this template you will need to have a target WebForms solution, in our examples below we reference the [*WingTipToys*]() project.  This is an older reference project that is freely available to anyone who wished to download it and give this template a try.  Once you have your project open inside of Visual Studio - go ahead and add a new Project to the solution of type Blazor - Server.

The compiled output of the WebFormsToBlazorServer project, a file called *WebFormsToBlazorServerCommands.cfx* file just needs to be dropped into the root solution folder of the WebForms project.

The next time that you open the WingTipToys solution the CodeFactory runtime will [load](http://docs.codefactory.software/guidance/usage-intro.html#consume-the-automation-template) the package and make the command available for use.

## Commands
There are currently two(2) commands that have been built inside of the project; 

- SetupBlazorProject
- MigrateWebForm

The first command, *SetupBlazorProject*, is an implementation of a [Project Command](http://docs.codefactory.software/guidance/overview-commands-intro.html) type and can be found by right-clicking on the Blazor project in your solution.  The command is found at the bottom of the context menu.

The second command, *MigrateWebForm*, is an implementation of a [Project Document Command](http://docs.codefactory.software/guidance/overview-commands-intro.html) type and can be found by right-clicking on any *.aspx file that is found in the *WingTipToys* project.
